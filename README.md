# Deezer playlist dataset and song recommendation with word2vec
Student machine learning project where we develop a word2vec network and use it to build a playlist completion tool (song suggestion), based on Deezer data.

The project is presented in a form of a jupyter notebook, the questions and answers are in the file and the outputs of the last execution are displayed.

Note : Deezer data is not included in this project, you will need to clone this git repository and put the content files in the _./data_ directory of this project.

```
git clone https://github.com/comeetie/deezerplay
```

Additionally, you can find the `latent_positions.npy` file in _./data_ directory which contains the numpy results of the last model's training, corresponding to the current outputs.

Finally, you will find the `stats_hyperparametres.xlsx` file in the root directory which contains statistics about 34 executions of the program with differents values for the model hyper-parameters. Each cell in green corresponds to the best value for <ins>one</ins> hyper parameter and the last line in green corresponds to the combination of all of these "optimal" values.
